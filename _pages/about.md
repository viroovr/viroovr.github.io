Hi, I am Hyeonwon Seo, an undergraduate student at SKKU, majoring in [Mechanical Engineering](http://mech.skku.edu/) and double majoring in [Software Engineering](https://sw.skku.edu/sw/).

My interest in mechanical complexity and inherent engineering led me to Mechanical Engineering, while my passion for computers from Data structure, Algorithm, Operating system classes drove me to additionally pursue Software Engineering.

I am still in pursuit of more substantial knowledge and outcomes, maintaining a keen interest in system design and analysis.
